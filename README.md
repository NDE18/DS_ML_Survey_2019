# DS_ML_Survey_2019
Tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration.
A “story” could be defined any number of ways, and that’s deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. That group can be defined in the macro (for example: anyone who does most of their coding in Python) or the micro (for example: female data science students studying machine learning in masters programs). This is an opportunity to be creative and tell the story of a community you identify with or are passionate about!
