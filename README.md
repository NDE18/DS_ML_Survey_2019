# DS_ML_Survey_2019
Tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration.
This survey comes from information collected from some Kaggle users. These respondents are 19,717.
Our “story” has been focused on the respondents (without forgetting the others) who perform at least one machine learning task (among those listed in survey) because we are talking about data science and machine learning, so it will be essential for us to rely on them. Here we have 9,226 respondents.
